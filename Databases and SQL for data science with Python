// week 5 final assignment

Assignment: Notebook for Peer Assignment
Introduction
Using this Python notebook you will:

Understand three Chicago datasets
Load the three datasets into three tables in a Db2 database
Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions
Understand the datasets
To complete the assignment problems in this notebook you will be using three datasets that are available on the city of Chicago's Data Portal:

Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago
Chicago Public Schools
Chicago Crime Data

1. Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago
This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.

A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2

2. Chicago Public Schools
This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. This dataset is provided by the city of Chicago's Data Portal.

A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t

3. Chicago Crime Data
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days.

A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

Download the datasets
This assignment requires you to have these three tables populated with a subset of the whole datasets.

In many cases the dataset to be analyzed is available as a .CSV (comma separated values) file, perhaps on the internet. Click on the links below to download and save the datasets (.CSV files):

Chicago Census Data

Chicago Public Schools

Chicago Crime Data

NOTE: Ensure you have downloaded the datasets using the links above instead of directly from the Chicago Data Portal. The versions linked here are subsets of the original datasets and have some of the column names modified to be more database friendly which will make it easier to complete this assignment.

Store the datasets in database tables
To analyze the data using SQL, it first needs to be stored in the database.

While it is easier to read the dataset into a Pandas dataframe and then PERSIST it into the database as we saw in Week 3 Lab 3, it results in mapping to default datatypes which may not be optimal for SQL querying. For example a long textual field may map to a CLOB instead of a VARCHAR.

Therefore, it is highly recommended to manually load the table using the database console LOAD tool, as indicated in Week 2 Lab 1 Part II. The only difference with that lab is that in Step 5 of the instructions you will need to click on create "(+) New Table" and specify the name of the table you want to create and then click "Next".


Now open the Db2 console, open the LOAD tool, Select / Drag the .CSV file for the first dataset, Next create a New Table, and then follow the steps on-screen instructions to load the data. Name the new tables as follows:
CENSUS_DATA
CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA
Connect to the database
Let us first load the SQL extension and establish a connection with the database

!pip install sqlalchemy==1.3.9
!pip install ibm_db_sa
%load_ext sql
In the next cell enter your db2 connection string. Recall you created Service Credentials for your Db2 instance in first lab in Week 3. From your Db2 service credentials copy everything after db2:// (except the double quote at the end) and paste it in the cell below after ibm_db_sa://


# Remember the connection string is of the format:
# %sql ibm_db_sa://my-username:my-password@my-hostname:my-port/my-db-name?security=SSL
# Enter the connection string for your Db2 on Cloud database instance below
%sql ibm_db_sa://
Problems
Now write and execute SQL queries to solve assignment problems

Problem 1
Find the total number of crimes recorded in the CRIME table.
%%sql
select count(*) from CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA
Problem 2
List community areas with per capita income less than 11000.
%%sql
select COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME , PER_CAPITAL_INCOME from CENSUS_DATA where PER_CAPITA_INCOME < 11000
Problem 3
List all case numbers for crimes involving minors?(children are not considered minors for the purposes of crime analysis)
%%sql
select CASE_NUMBER,PRIMARY_TYPE,DESCRIPTION from CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA where DESCRIPTION like '%MINOR%' or PRIMARY_TYPE like '%MINOR%'
Problem 4
List all kidnapping crimes involving a child?
%%sql
select * from CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA where PRIMARY_TYPE = 'KIDNAPPING' and DESCRIPTION like '%CHILD%';
Problem 5
What kinds of crimes were recorded at schools?
%%sql
select distinct(PRIMARY_TYPE) from CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA where LOCATION_DESCRIPTION like '%SCHOOL%'
Problem 6
List the average safety score for all types of schools.
%%sql
select "Elementary, Middle, or High School", avg(safety_score) as average_safety_score
from CHICAGO_PRIMARY_SCHOOLS group by "Elementary, Middle, or High School"
Problem 7
List 5 community areas with highest % of households below poverty line
%%sql
select community_area_name, percent_households_below_poverty from CENSUS_DATA
order by percent_households_below_poverty desc nulls last limit 5;
Problem 8
Which community area is most crime prone?
%%sql
select community_area_name from CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA group by community_area_name 
order by count(*) desc nulls last limit 1
Double-click here for a hint

Problem 9
Use a sub-query to find the name of the community area with highest hardship index
%%sql
select community_area_name from CENSUS_DATA where hardship_index = (select MAX(hardship_index) from CENSUS_DATA)
Problem 10
Use a sub-query to determine the Community Area Name with most number of crimes?
%%sql
select COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME from CENSUS_DATA where COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER in 
(select COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER from CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA group by  COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER order by count(*) desc limit 1)
